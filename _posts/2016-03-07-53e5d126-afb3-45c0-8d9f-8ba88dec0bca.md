**_Contact, Scheduling, and Prices_**

Contact Me:

Tenisha Dandridge LAc.

wisdomhealer@gmail.com

410-262-4308 

(Text messages greatly appreciated and responded to faster than voicemails)

**_Scheduling_**

By appointment only. Due to the nature of a mobile business online scheduling is not currently available. Most appointment requests can be honored the same week.

**_Prices_**

You are in luck! I'm currently offering spring specials. I'm waiving new patient fees if you have a friend or a loved one who is receiving a treatment with you.

Regular

$100

Children, Students, and Seniors 65+

$80

What do you get? About an hour of my time and what ever treatment protocol that needs to be done that day. I don't charge extra for cupping, tui na, e-stim, or anything else I do. The one exception is herbs. The herbal consult is included but the herbs themselves are an extra and usually run $20-30 a bottle. You are welcome to purchase them from me or online.
