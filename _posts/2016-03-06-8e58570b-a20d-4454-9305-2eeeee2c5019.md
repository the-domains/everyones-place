Greetings My Name is Tenisha Dandridge LAc.

I was born in Sacramento, CA and raised in a military family.  I started my undergraduate at Morgan State University in electrical engineering and computer
science. After the loss of my grandmother and multiple health crisis's of my own, I became
interested in natural medicine. I received both a B.S. and a M.S. in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine from Bastyr
University, one of the leading schools of Natural Medicine in the
United States. 

I began my first private practice in 2009 after graduating with over 1000 scholastic clinical hours in acupuncture and over 400 scholastic clinical hours with Chinese Herbal Medicine. My training at Bastyr included:

\* 3
internships at Harborview Medical Center working
with both HIV and other immune compromised individuals.  Other duties included working with refugee patients with pain, traumatic injuries, and PTSD 

\* 3
internships at Highline Cancer center working with patients before, during and
after chemotherapy while also working with individuals in remission

\*1
internship at Highpoint Community Clinic working with the local impoverished community

\*10
internships at Bastyr Center for Natural Health working with the general public with a cornocopia of health
concerns including pain management, stress, internal
medicine, fertility issues, GI complaints, edema,
and infectious diseases which included MRSA, Hepatitis,
HIV, and the common cold. 

Now with more than 7 years of clinical experience I have been trained in many modalities. A partial list of my training includes; NADA,  Acutonics, Master Tung's and Dr. Tan Acupuncture, 5 Alement, Auricular Acupuncture, Hand and Head Micro Systems, Tui Na, Acutonics, Nutrition, Tai Qi, Qi Gong, Western Clinical Sciences and Lifestyle Counseling. I have recently moved back to Sacramento to and I am eagerly looking forward to serving my home town.
