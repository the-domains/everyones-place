**So the burning question is what can acupuncture do for you?  **

I always love meeting that person who tells me they don't need acupuncture. To me that's like turning down a massage. Unless you have had one in the last 24 hours then you need one. Acupuncture is safe, effective and there is no such thing as to much. That's right you can't over do it. You can get a treatment every single day and its only going to keep improving your overall physical well being. We make the mistake of thinking that wellness is a destination. It isn't. Everyone is on is in a different place in their health maintenance goals.  

Wellness is a path not a destination; and each journey is unique. I am an honored guest on your path to wellness. I will neither walk ahead of my patients nor behind my patients. Instead, I will be right beside my patients offering wisdom and companionship as they need it. In this way people can be the master of their own well being.
