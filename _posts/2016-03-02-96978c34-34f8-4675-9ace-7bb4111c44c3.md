![Why Mobile Acupuncture?](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/aef92dd1f14cb0c9259e6c12346ddc234e6a6e08.jpg)

**Welcome to Everyone's Place: Acupuncture and Wellness**

Sacramento's only Mobile Acupuncture and Wellness Service. Pardon the dust as I continue to update this website.

**Why Mobile Acupuncture?**

Why not? What ever happened to the old fashioned house call with the bare foot doctor and the medcine bag?What happened to the person who could come to your home see your whole family and show you how to make your life work better for you? Our society traded that in for the rising health care costs of modern day institutions like hospitals and medical insurance. 

**So why Mobile acupuncture****?**

Convenience and ease, who doesn't like that? Because everyone can't get to a clinic. Some people are disabled or in to much agony for them to leave their house for 20-60 min drive, get into a clinic and back out, then drive back after treatment. If you have ever thrown your back out you have an idea of what I mean. Some people are legitimately to busy. The extra time lost in commuting back and forth to a clinic makes being compliant with regular self care next to impossible. Still others just like relaxing in their own bed watching their own tv while they gently fall into an acupuncture induced nap (if you have never had one then you should schedule ASAP). After the needles are removed you don't have to ruin the relaxation by jumping back into traffic and the hustle and bustle of life. You can continue to relax in the comfort of your own home and l'll lock the door behind me.

**Can I do all that crazy ancient Chinese medicine in your home, office, or even for large groups**? 

You betcha. All you need is a comfortable chair and a quiet space to relax. I'll bring everything else. Even for conditions like back, hip, groin pain, and even home births you can have a safe, gentle, effective treatments in the comfort and privacy of your own home or office. I can comfortably treat 4-6 patients and hour  for full service and even more if you want mini treatments for even larger goups like churches and community events. So yes this is great opportunity for groups and parties.
